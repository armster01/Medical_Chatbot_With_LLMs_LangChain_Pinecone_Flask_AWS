# 🩺 Medical Chatbot with LLMs, LangChain, Pinecone, Flask & AWS

An advanced **AI-powered Medical Chatbot** that leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **LangChain**, and **Pinecone Vector Database** to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to medical-related queries.  
This chatbot is deployed on **AWS Cloud** with a **Flask backend**, enabling scalable, secure, and reliable healthcare interactions.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The **Medical Chatbot** acts as an intelligent healthcare assistant that can:
- Understand user queries related to medical symptoms, diseases, and treatments.  
- Retrieve accurate medical information using **vector similarity search** from **Pinecone DB**.  
- Generate human-like, contextual answers through **LLMs integrated via LangChain**.  
- Provide a simple, interactive web interface built with **Flask**.
